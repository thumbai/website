# Features

THUMBAI app provides features to have your own - 

* Go Modules Respository for your organization
* Decouple SCM repository import path using Go Vanity

Every feature is on-demand and individual use. Above use cases fully utilized by aahframework.org and aahframe.work, THUMBAI replaced my nginx proxy server.
