            <p>Initially I thought of having project name as <code>gorepositree</code>. Then I have changed my thoughts and started looking for name without any feature name included in it. I did my findings and finally choosen THUMBAI as a project name.</p>
            <p><strong>THUMBAI</strong> is a flower name (Binomial name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucas_aspera" target="_blank">Leucas aspera</a>).</p>
